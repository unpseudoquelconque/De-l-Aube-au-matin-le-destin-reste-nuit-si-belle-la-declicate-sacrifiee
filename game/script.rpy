    scene opening night
    r "The roots flew confidently through the haze of twilight."
    l "Think he's still sleeping ?"
    e "Considering how much of a slack he is, wouldn't surprise me."
    l "Wether you're surprised or not, he's still the one with the keys"
    scene dirty dream
    r "Look at it, seeping into the clouds."
    e "Fuck it. I'll just break down the door. He'll pay for it anyway."
    l "Please don't. I don't want to end up on the dean's list."
    l "Let's just hope he'll wake up before classes"
    r "Slowly the wool dries as they leave for a new home."
    r "Ah, will this despicable roaming ever cease ?"
    r "You can hear the lock slowly giving away, drawing you further away from the dream."
    r "Maybe next time, you'll be able to partake in its joyful beauty..."
    "Those idiots are at it again, aren't they ?"
    "Let's really piss them off. I'm pretty sure she's got the key anyway."
    "The room is ripe with what amount to a lot of garbage."
    "THEIR garbage. One they are quite keen on getting back apparently"
    "Well I'm not opening. I'm through with opening doors."
    "Ahaha how the mighty have fallen. All hail the new king."
    "   "
    "Shit she's gonna destroy my door."
    e "Well if it isn't our very own shitface master"
    "I'll have you know, i'm not that drunk"
    l "Just move over please. We've got classes in about ... "
    l "We're late."
    e "Great. Where's the paper ?"
    "Under the window."
    e "It better be intact. You know how hard this thing is to find."
    "No idea. *Ponk*"
    l "I know you're fresh out of bed but you could still try to speak."
    "What's the point, when you can all hear what I think anyway ?"
    l "Oh, the mindfreak is going full drama queen on us today !"
    e "Damned be those incredible powers of mine, for the path I must take is one of solitude and apathy !"
    l "What terrible path ! Could sleep ever ease your mind ?"
    e "No ship strong enough to face the storms brewing through the hell of the self I fear ! Ah dear the pain ! I live as but a fleeting shadow !"
    e "I'll open the curtains, that'll help you join us in the real world."
    "God I'm blind ! I can't see ! AAAaaaa"
    e "See you in Lorfelin's class !"
    "Oh right. I'll just go back to sleep then."
    l "It's in 30 minute, Zar. Wake the fuck up."
    "What is it with you two and verbal abuse today ? Didn't mama teach you not to curse ?"
    "I mean, you just break in, ask for this stupid, normie shite for your useless course on how to be what most people wish they werent."
    "I'll have you know I was close to nothing less than a discussion with God !"
    "And now its ruined because of you two noisy bastards."
    "They've left haven't they ?"
    "Well having my thoughts all to myself once again is always a plus."
    "Still don't want to open my eyes though."
    "    "
    "Actually what time is it ?"
    "I might already be late."
    "Not that I care."
    "I should really check."
    "    "
    "Let's just wake up."
    "Its raining outside but I can't hear it. Once again, technology has failed us."
    "Is there anything in the fridge ?"
    "Yogurt'll do just fine."
    "Maybe the earth IS flat. But then, how would its corners be defined ? Maybe there's a wall, but that would allow for some cracks. Then again, maybe those cracks do exist and might explain some environnemental transformations"
    "Shit, Goras is awake. I need to get out of there, quick."
    "But if the earth is flat, where do the leprechaun live ? Maybe they use pocket dimensions to hide themselves... Or they might be just small enough to live inside the ground."
    "That moron is gonna make me lose it."
    "Let's put this on for a change. Where is my bag ?"
    "I really hope Leuze calls me back. Last week's date was great. I think she likes me. Probably not. She's really hot."
    "One. Two. Three. Four. Fiiive. Siiiiix. Seeeeveeeeeeeeeen. Ei... Fuck."
    "Who is that ? What happened last night ? Think. Think. Let's not panick."
    "That dream again. I just need to sleep. Maybe the shrink will help with that. . That fucking coffee machine broke again. Fucking wankers taking care of the flat. . I want to marry that woman. . I can't pee with this."
    "Oh no it's happening again. I do love me some bacon and egg. They all want me dead, all the normies with their silly hat and dumb woky idea. My mother is dead. FUCK THAT HURT BLOODY FUCKING TABLE. Let's cram a bit before the test."
    "finally a good night of sleep shit it's raining again what if time depended on rotation leuze just blocked me where is the number mom sent me I couldn't even attend the funeral i need to get stronger seven is pathetic like a fucking queer"

    "..."
    "I need to find a house."
    "There was that theory that eventually every Soprani living in the same district will eventually synchronize their living habits."
    "Here's to hoping that never happens."
    "People really can't drive in this city, can they ?"
    "And now he's flipping me off."
    "Probably heard me. Maybe not."
    "My range seems to have somewhat grown over the years. How large was it when I graduated highschool ? Can't have been more than a meter radius."
    "Measuring it with Witt was fun. That was ages ago."
